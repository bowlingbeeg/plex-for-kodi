# ZidooPlexMod (for Kodi)

This is a modification of the PlexMod script by pannal(https://github.com/pannal/plex-for-kodi) to work with the native zidoo player on zidoo machines.

It requires version 2.0+ of the PlexToZidoo app found here https://github.com/bowlingbeeg/PlexToZidoo/releases
Follow the install instructions of PlexToZidoo but ignore all of the setup of the native Plex app since the ZidooPlexMod will be your interface to Plex.


## Installation

Download the latest release and install manually as a zip file(https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_manager#How_to_install_from_a_ZIP_file)

## Tips

If you want a custom layout for your library list you can copy the file, customlayout.xml, from the <kodi_path>/addons/script.zidooplexmod directory to the <kodi_path>/userdata/addon_data/script.zidooplexmod/ directory.  Then edit it with the layout you want.  You can have unique layouts for each user, a default one that everyone shares, or a combination of both.  See the customlayout.xml file for details.
