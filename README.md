# ZidooPlexMod (for Kodi)

This is a modification of the PlexMod script by pannal(https://github.com/pannal/plex-for-kodi) to work with the native zidoo player on zidoo machines.

It requires version 2.0+ of the PlexToZidoo app found here https://github.com/bowlingbeeg/PlexToZidoo/releases
Follow the install instructions for PlexToZidoo(https://github.com/bowlingbeeg/PlexToZidoo#readme) but ignore all of the setup of the native Plex app since the ZidooPlexMod will be your interface to Plex.


## Installation

### Via repository
* Add `https://bowlingbeeg.github.io/bowlingbeeg.kodi/` to your Kodi installation as a file source
* Go back to addons, choose zip file, choose the file source you added and install the repository
* Install ZidooPlexMod via Addons->Install from repository->bowlingbeeg.kodi->Video add-ons->ZidooPlexMod

### Manual
