Copy this file into the userdata/addon_data/script.zidooplexmod/ directory.  You can customize the
layout for each server and user by specifying a section for every user in you Plex server or you can
setup a 'default' user so that every user who doesn't have a specific layout will use that default
layout.  If a 'default' section isn't provided and a user doesn't have it's own section then
ZidooPlexMod will pick the order.
Arrange the libraries in the order that you want them shown on the title bar.  Anything you don't
put into this list will be displayed at the end.  If you want to hide a library then add "hide" to
the xml entry.  You can add or remove as many users/libraries as necessary to accommodate your Plex
server.
